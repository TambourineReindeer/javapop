# Introduction #

An isometric god game


# Details #

I couldn't find a populous clone out there, so I'm starting one.
javapop uses [jogl](https://jogl.dev.java.net/) for rendering, see instructions there for installing it for development.

To run the game, I'm envisioning using java web start, so downloading jogl separately shouldn't be necessary.
Try it [here!](http://javapop.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/javapop.jnlp)
Cheers,
