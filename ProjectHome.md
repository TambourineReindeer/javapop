Alpha release April 29th 2009.

  * Still an unfinished demo at the moment, but hopefully people can see the idea behind this.
  * Volcano, earthquake, basalt, swamp, lightning and a few other effects are implemented.
  * Many others are deliberately not implemented to encourage others to contribute!
  * General controls:
    * Left mouse raises land, right mouse (or ctrl-click) lowers land.
    * 'F' key toggles fullscreen
    * Holding middle mouse button down, arrow keys or two finger trackpad dragging (mac, OSX10.5 and up only) will scroll map.
