#summary Introduction to javapop

= Introduction =

An isometric god game


= Details =

I couldn't find a populous clone out there, so I'm starting one.
javapop uses [https://jogl.dev.java.net/ jogl] for rendering, see instructions there for installing it for development.

To run the game, I'm envisioning using java web start, so downloading jogl separately shouldn't be necessary.

Cheers,
