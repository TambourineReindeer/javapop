#summary The necessary steps to add a new spell or tool

  # Add a new enum value to `ToolType` in the `Client.Tools.Tool` interface.
  # Make a new class for your tool in `Client.Tools`, extending `BaseTool`.
  # Add an instance of your new class to the `BaseTool.tools` collection in `BaseTool.Initialise`. This is the link between the enum and your actual tool.
  # Make an icon. Current icons are 64x64 png images in `com.novusradix.javapop.icons`
  # Add a `JToggleButton` in `ControlPalette`
    * Assign the icon
    * Add a tooltip
    * Add it to the `ToolGroup` button group
    * Create an action method that calls `BaseTool.setTool(ToolType.MyNewTool, false);` (Double click it the button in Netbeans to create the method, then fill it in.)

In most cases I imagine you'll also want to create a new Message subtype and send an instance in the tool's `PrimaryAction` method if the spell is to execute on the server.

n.b. I think this is currently too many steps (hence the documentation!) and as I add more tools this will probably become more programmatic.
